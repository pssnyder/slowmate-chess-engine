## 🎯 **USER REQUEST FULFILLED**

### **✅ Original Goals Achieved:**
> "lets also check the endgame evaluation calculation, its providing some odd values such as +Mate in 500/8 which doesn't make sense… please investigate... then add a task during this endgame enhancements to also enhance the game eval to properly detect endgames and mating and verify eval calculations all together…"

> "this is also in an effort to impact the engines auto-adjudication which seems to be kicking in very often compared to other engines evals."
