Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Context**
   - The SlowMate Chess Engine is a Python-based chess engine designed for educational purposes. It emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and adherence to the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) standards.
   - The project is structured to allow incremental development, with each feature being implemented step-by-step and thoroughly documented.

2. **Coding Guidelines**
   - **Clarity**: Code should be easy to read and understand. Use descriptive variable and function names.
   - **Simplicity**: Avoid unnecessary complexity. Aim for straightforward solutions that are easy to maintain.
   - **Documentation**: Document all code thoroughly. This includes inline comments, function docstrings, and external documentation as needed.
   - **Testing**: Implement tests for all new features and ensure existing tests are not broken by changes.
   - **Version Control**: Use Git for version control. Commit changes frequently with clear, descriptive messages.
   - **Collaboration**: Be open to feedback and collaboration. Discuss major changes with the team before implementing them.
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
```powerShell
# use proper PowerShell syntax for this version, i.e. '&&' operators are not supported
```

3. **Project Structure**
   - Follow the established project structure as outlined in the documentation. This includes directories for the main engine code, documentation, and tests.
   - Use a consistent naming convention for files and directories to enhance navigability.
