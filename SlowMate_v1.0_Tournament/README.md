# SlowMate Chess Engine

A self-learning, incremental chess engine built in Python with emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and UCI compatibility.

## Project Philosophy

SlowMate is designed as a step-by-step learning project where each feature is implemented incrementally with clear documentation of the development process. This approach allows for:

- **Transparency**: Every decision and implementation step is documented
- **Self-Learning**: Engine analyzes its own games to build tactical knowledge
- **Maintainability**: Simple, readable code over complex optimizations
- **Modularity**: Features can be easily added, modified, or rolled back
- **Compatibility**: Built to UCI (Universal Chess Interface) standards for integration with chess software

## Current Status

🏆 **V1.0 RELEASE COMPLETE!** 🏆

**MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: SlowMate v1.0 establishes a clean, stable, reproducible baseline with clarified evaluation hierarchy (material, PST, mobility, king safety), accurate mate scoring, fixed-depth alpha-beta search, and a simplified, test-validated UCI integration ready for future iterative deepening and time management enhancements.
