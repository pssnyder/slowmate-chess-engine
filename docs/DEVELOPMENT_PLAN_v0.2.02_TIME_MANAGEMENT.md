```

### Integration Points
- **Search System**: Integrate with existing `slowmate/search/` modules
- **UCI Interface**: Enhance `slowmate_uci.py` with time command support
- **Engine Core**: Update `slowmate/engine.py` for time-aware operation
- **Statistics**: Add time management metrics to existing statistics system

### Time Control Formats
| Format | Description | Implementation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Classical | 40/90+30 (40 moves in 90 min + 30 sec increment) | Full support |
| Rapid | 15+10 (15 minutes + 10 second increment) | Full support |
| Blitz | 3+2 (3 minutes + 2 second increment) | Full support |
| Bullet | 1+0 (1 minute, no increment) | Emergency mode |
| Fixed Depth | depth N (search to fixed depth) | Depth-only mode |
| Fixed Nodes | nodes N (search N nodes) | Node-limited mode |
