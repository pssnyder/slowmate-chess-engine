## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (v1.0.0-BETA)
1. Port core components from v0.2.0_BETA
2. Implement basic UCI protocol
3. Set up testing framework
4. Validate move generation
5. Test basic functionality

### Phase 2: Core Enhancement (v1.1.0)
1. Implement middlegame tactics
2. Add basic time management
3. Enhance evaluation function
4. Test position analysis

### Phase 3: Search Enhancement (v1.2.0)
1. Add iterative deepening
2. Implement aspiration windows
3. Optimize move ordering
4. Test search stability

### Phase 4: Knowledge Integration (v1.3.0)
1. Add opening book support
2. Implement endgame patterns
3. Optimize phase transitions
4. Test knowledge integration

### Phase 5: UCI Enhancement (v1.4.0)
1. Add advanced UCI features
2. Implement multi-threading
3. Add configuration options
4. Final stability testing

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for systems
- Tournament testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Regression testing suite

### Performance Metrics
- Move generation speed
- Node exploration rate
- Memory usage
- UCI response time
- Tournament results

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Knowledge Integration Complexity**
