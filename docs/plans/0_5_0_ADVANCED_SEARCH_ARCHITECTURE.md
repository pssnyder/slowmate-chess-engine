SlowMate v0.5.0 - ADVANCED SEARCH ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
=================================================================

COMPREHENSIVE MODERN CHESS ENGINE SEARCH IMPLEMENTATION
Transition from basic alpha-beta to state-of-the-art search architecture.

TARGET ARCHITECTURE:
==================

1. CORE SEARCH ALGORITHM: NegaScout (Principal Variation Search)
   - Modern successor to minimax with alpha-beta
   - Widely accepted standard in top-tier engines
   - Provides optimal performance with proper move ordering
   - Framework for advanced pruning techniques

2. ADVANCED MOVE ORDERING SYSTEM:
   - Transposition Table Moves (from hash table)
   - Principal Variation Moves (from previous iteration)
   - Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE) for captures
   - Killer Moves (non-captures that caused cutoffs)
   - History Heuristic (general quiet move quality)
   - Counter Moves (responses to opponent's last move)

3. SEARCH ENHANCEMENTS:
   - Null Move Pruning (with verification)
   - Quiescence Search (tactical search at leaves)
   - Late Move Reductions (LMR)
   - Futility Pruning
   - Razoring
   - Check Extensions

4. EVALUATION ARCHITECTURE:
   - Modular evaluation system for neural network integration
   - Hand-crafted evaluation functions
   - Contempt factor implementation
   - Auto-tuning genetic algorithm framework
   - SEE calculation for sacrifices

5. ADVANCED FEATURES:
   - Initiative and tempo evaluation
   - Tactical position setup preferences
   - "Ask opponent a question" heuristics
   - Draw avoidance mechanisms
   - Comprehensive position analysis

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:
====================

Phase A: Core NegaScout Implementation
Phase B: Advanced Move Ordering System  
Phase C: Search Enhancement Integration
Phase D: Modular Evaluation Architecture
Phase E: Contempt and Initiative Systems
Phase F: Auto-tuning and Neural Network Framework

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
=================
- Significant playing strength improvement
- Modern, maintainable codebase
- Foundation for neural network integration
- Competitive with commercial engines
- Educational value for chess programming
