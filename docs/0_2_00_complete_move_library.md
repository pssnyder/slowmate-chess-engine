## Technical Architecture

### 1. Unified Knowledge Base System

#### **Complete Move Library Integration**
```
Move Selection Priority (Unified):
1. Immediate Tactics (checkmate threats, tactical combinations)
2. Learned Middlegame Patterns (from v0.1.03 self-learning system)
3. Opening Book Knowledge (position-based with preferences)  
4. Strategic Endgame Patterns (preparation for final phase)
5. Tactical Evaluation (SEE-based analysis)
6. Minimax Search (alpha-beta with quiescence)
```

#### **Intelligent Phase Detection**
- **Opening Phase**: Move 1-15, development focus, opening book priority
- **Middlegame Phase**: Move 16-40, tactical patterns emphasis, learned combinations
- **Endgame Phase**: Few pieces remaining, endgame tablebase/pattern priority
- **Transition Recognition**: Dynamic switching between phases based on position characteristics

### 2. Enhanced Knowledge Coordinator

#### **Universal Move Interface**
```python
class UnifiedKnowledgeBase:
    def get_best_move(self, position, game_phase):
        # Intelligent phase-based move selection
        # Integration of all knowledge sources
        # Priority-based selection with confidence weighting
        pass
