**Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned  
**Phase**: Post-Release Enhancement  
**Version**: 1.1.0  
**Engine ID**: slowmate_1.1.0_time_management  

## Overview

The Advanced Time Management System aims to enhance SlowMate's tournament performance by implementing sophisticated time allocation strategies and decision-making processes.

## Current Status Analysis

### Strengths (v1.0)
- Strong overall performance (78.38% win rate)
- Solid positional understanding
- Good tactical awareness

### Areas for Improvement
- Time-related losses in complex positions
- Suboptimal time usage in critical positions
- Limited adaptation to different time controls

## Implementation Goals

### 1. Dynamic Time Allocation
- Implement position complexity assessment
- Adjust search depth based on position evaluation
- Reserve time for critical game phases
- Handle sudden time pressure scenarios

### 2. Game Phase Awareness
- Different time strategies for opening, middlegame, and endgame
- Position-specific time allocation
- Critical position detection and handling
- Book position time optimization

### 3. Opponent Time Management
- Monitor opponent's time usage
- Adapt strategy based on opponent's time pressure
- Implement practical pressure tactics in time advantage

### 4. Tournament Specific Features
- Support for different time control formats
- Increment/delay handling optimization
- Emergency move selection in time trouble
- Smart feature toggling based on time remaining

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
```python
class TimeManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.total_time = 0
        self.increment = 0
        self.moves_to_go = 0
        self.phase_weights = {
            'opening': 0.2,
            'middlegame': 0.5,
            'endgame': 0.3
        }

    def calculate_move_time(self, position, complexity, phase):
        # Dynamic time calculation based on multiple factors
        pass

    def adjust_for_complexity(self, base_time, complexity):
        # Adjust time based on position complexity
        pass

    def emergency_time_handler(self):
        # Handle severe time pressure situations
        pass
```

### Integration Points
1. UCI Protocol Enhancement
   - New time management commands
