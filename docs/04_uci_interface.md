# 04 - UCI Interface Implementation

**Date**: July 19, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Phase**: UCI Protocol Implementation

## Objectives
1. Implement UCI (Universal Chess Interface) protocol for compatibility with chess GUIs
2. Create command-line interface that responds to standard UCI commands
3. Test integration with Nibbler.exe for real-world validation
4. Establish foundation for engine testing against other engines (Stockfish, etc.)

## UCI Protocol Requirements

The UCI protocol defines a standard set of commands that chess engines must support:

### Core UCI Commands (Required)
- **`uci`**: Initialize UCI mode, respond with engine info and `uciok`
- **`ucinewgame`**: Prepare for a new game
- **`position`**: Set up board position (starting position or FEN + moves)
- **`go`**: Start thinking/searching for best move
- **`stop`**: Stop thinking immediately
- **`quit`**: Terminate the engine
- **`isready`**: Engine readiness check, respond with `readyok`

### Engine Response Commands
- **`id name <name>`**: Engine name identification
- **`id author <author>`**: Engine author identification  
- **`uciok`**: Confirm UCI initialization complete
- **`readyok`**: Confirm engine is ready
- **`bestmove <move>`**: Return the best move found

### Optional UCI Commands (Future Implementation)
- **`setoption`**: Configure engine parameters
- **`debug`**: Toggle debug mode
- **`ponderhit`**: Ponder move was played
- **`info`**: Send analysis information during search

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 2a: Basic UCI Stub (Current)
- Implement core UCI command parsing
- Return dummy/minimal responses for all required commands
- Focus on getting Nibbler.exe recognition working
- Validate protocol compliance with basic functionality

### Phase 2b: Full UCI Integration (Future)
- Integrate UCI with existing SlowMateEngine
- Add search info reporting during move selection
- Implement position management and game state sync
- Add configurable engine options

## Technical Architecture

### UCI Interface Design
```python
class UCIInterface:
    def __init__(self, engine):
        self.engine = engine
        self.debug = False
    
    def run(self):
        # Main UCI command loop
        
    def handle_uci(self):
        # Engine identification and capabilities
        
    def handle_position(self, args):
        # Set board position from UCI command
        
    def handle_go(self, args):
        # Start move search with given parameters
        
    def handle_bestmove(self, move):
        # Send best move to GUI
```

### Integration Points
- **Engine Bridge**: Connect UCI commands to SlowMateEngine methods
- **Position Sync**: Translate UCI position commands to engine board state
- **Move Translation**: Convert between UCI move format and engine move format
- **Search Management**: Handle UCI search parameters (time, depth, etc.)

## Testing Plan

### Nibbler.exe Integration
1. Create UCI executable that Nibbler can launch
2. Test engine recognition and initial communication
3. Validate position setup and move requests
4. Confirm move responses are properly formatted

### Protocol Validation
- Test all required UCI commands individually
- Verify proper response timing and format
- Ensure engine doesn't crash on malformed input
- Test integration with multiple UCI-compatible tools

## Success Criteria

### Phase 2a Success Metrics
- âœ… Nibbler.exe recognizes SlowMate as valid engine
- âœ… Engine responds to basic UCI commands without crashing  
- âœ… Can set up starting position and make moves
- âœ… Returns properly formatted UCI moves

### Future Enhancement Readiness
- Clean separation between UCI protocol and engine logic
- Extensible command handling for future UCI features
- Foundation for search info reporting and engine options
- Ready for integration with advanced search algorithms
