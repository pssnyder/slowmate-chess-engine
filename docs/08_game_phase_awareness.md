**Date**: July 19, 2025  
**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Phase**: Positional Intelligence  
**Version**: 0.0.07  
**Engine ID**: slowmate_0.0.07_game_phase_awareness  

## Overview
Document 08 covers the complete implementation of piece-square tables (PSTs) in the SlowMate chess engine, from basic universal tables through piece-specific implementations to sophisticated game phase awareness. This represents the engine's evolution from simple material evaluation to advanced positional understanding.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Universal Base PST
- **Goal**: Introduce positional scoring beyond pure material evaluation
- **Implementation**: Single PST table applied to all piece types
- **Result**: Engine begins to prefer center squares and avoid edges

### Phase 2: Piece-Specific PSTs  
- **Goal**: Tailor positional preferences to each piece type's characteristics
- **Implementation**: Separate PST tables for Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King
- **Result**: Sophisticated piece development and positioning

### Phase 2.1: PST Refinements
- **Goal**: Fix specific issues identified in testing
- **Fixes**: Pawn center control, King safety, Rook 7th rank bonuses
- **Result**: Balanced and accurate positional evaluation

### Phase 3: Game Phase Awareness
- **Goal**: Adapt strategy based on Opening/Middlegame/Endgame phases
- **Implementation**: Phase detection algorithm + endgame-specific PSTs
- **Result**: Strategic adaptability and endgame expertise

**Date**: July 19, 2025

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Excellent Strategic Decisions Observed**

##### 1. En Passant Excellence
- **Move Context**: White played en passant when Black overextended pawns
- **Strategic Value**: 
  - Fixed White's pawn structure
  - Placed attacking pawn "right at opponent's doorstep"
  - Created immediate pressure requiring Black response
- **Technical Note**: Pawn arrived at capture square via earlier capture, making en passant a structure-improving move

##### 2. Appropriate Castling Timing
- **White Castling (Move 12)**: Castled at suitable time after piece development
- **Black Castling (Move 15)**: Very late but still took advantage when available
- **PST Impact**: Castling manipulates scores of both King and Rook simultaneously
- **Strategic Benefit**: Got "free piece move" by coordinating two pieces

##### 3. PST-Based Development Working
- Engine following basic positional principles
- Good piece coordination and development patterns
- Tactical opportunities being created through positional play

## Technical Implementation

### Phase 2: Piece-Specific PST Tables

#### Pawn PST - Advancement and Center Control
```python
PAWN_PST = [
    # Rank 1-2: Starting positions (neutral)
    0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,
    0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,   0,
    # Rank 3: Early development
    5,  10,  10, -20, -20,  10,  10,   5,
    # Rank 4: Strong center control (+20 for e4/d4!)
    5,  -5, -10,  20,  20, -10,  -5,   5,
    # Rank 5-7: Progressive advancement bonuses
    0,   0,   0,  25,  25,   0,   0,   0,
   10,  10,  20,  30,  30,  20,  10,  10,
   50,  50,  50,  50,  50,  50,  50,  50,
]
```

#### Knight PST - Center Preference, Edge Avoidance
```python
KNIGHT_PST = [
    # Strong center preference (+20 for e4/d4)
    # Heavy penalties for edges (-40 to -50)
    # Development squares (f3, c3) get +10 to +15
]
```

#### King PST - Safety vs Activity
```python
KING_PST = [
    # Back rank safety: e1 = +5, g1 = +30 (castling bonus)
    # Center heavily penalized in opening/middlegame
    # Designed to encourage castling and safety
]
```

### Phase 3: Game Phase Detection Algorithm

```python
def detect_game_phase(self):
    # Count material and pieces per side
    if total_material < 1300 or total_pieces < 6:
        return 'endgame'
    elif total_material > 2000 or total_pieces > 12:
        return 'opening'
    else:
        return 'middlegame'
```

### Phase 3: Endgame-Specific PST Tables

#### Pawn Endgame PST - "Promote at All Costs!"
- **Rank 3**: 20-35 bonus (aggressive advancement)
- **Rank 4**: 30-50 bonus (strong push forward)
- **Rank 5**: 50-80 bonus (very advanced)
- **Rank 6**: 80-120 bonus (almost there!)
- **Rank 7**: +200 bonus (maximum promotion value!)

#### King Endgame PST - "Activate and Centralize!"
- **Back Rank**: -20 to -5 (get off the back rank!)
- **Rank 3-4**: 0 to +25 (good activity)
- **Rank 5-6**: +10 to +35 (excellent centralization)
- **Rank 7-8**: +15 to +35 (support pawn advancement)

#### Rook Endgame PST - "Control Ranks, Limit Opponent"
- **Rank 7**: +15 to +30 (excellent attacking rank)
- **Central Files**: +10 to +15 (avoid edges)
- **Back Ranks**: +5 to +25 (control important squares)

## Performance Results and Testing

### Phase 2.1 Fixes Validation
- âœ… **Pawn e4**: +0 â†’ +20 (proper center control)
- âœ… **King e1**: -50 â†’ +5 (appropriate safety)
- âœ… **King g1**: +30 (excellent castling bonus)
- âœ… **Rook e7**: +0 â†’ +15 (7th rank attack value)

### Phase 3 Dramatic Strategic Shifts
- **Pawn e7 (promotion)**: +50 â†’ +200 (+150 improvement!)
- **King e4 (center)**: -40 â†’ +25 (+65 swing to centralize!)
- **King e5 (advanced)**: -50 â†’ +30 (+80 swing to advance!)

### Endgame Move Selection Excellence
- **K+P Endgame**: Prioritizes pawn advancement (e4: +170, e3: +155)
- **Promotion Race**: Instant recognition (b8=Q: +990 points)
- **King Activity**: Strong preference for centralization and support

### Phase Transition Behavior
The engine smoothly transitions between phases:
- **Opening**: Piece development and safety focus (Nc3, Nf3 preferred)
- **Middlegame**: Uses standard piece-specific PSTs
- **Endgame**: Activates specialized endgame behavior (pawn push, king activation)

## Enhanced _get_pst_value() Method
```python
def _get_pst_value(self, square, piece_type, color):
    game_phase = self.detect_game_phase()
    
    # Select appropriate PST based on piece type and game phase
    if piece_type == chess.PAWN and game_phase == 'endgame':
        return self.PAWN_ENDGAME_PST[flipped_square]
    elif piece_type == chess.KING and game_phase == 'endgame':
        return self.KING_ENDGAME_PST[flipped_square]
    elif piece_type == chess.ROOK and game_phase == 'endgame':
        return self.ROOK_ENDGAME_PST[flipped_square]
    # ... fall back to standard PSTs for other pieces/phases
```
