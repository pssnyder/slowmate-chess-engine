## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS

### Emergency Fixes Implemented

#### 1. **Illegal Move Prevention** ‚úÖ
```python
def _validate_move_legal(self, move) -> bool:
    """CRITICAL FIX: Strict move validation to prevent illegal moves."""
    legal_moves = list(self.board.board.legal_moves)
    if move not in legal_moves:
        return False
    return True
```

#### 2. **UCI Protocol Stabilization** ‚úÖ
```python
def _handle_go(self, args):
    """CRITICAL FIX: Robust search handling with emergency fallbacks."""
    # Always ensure we have a time limit
    # Always return a legal move
    # Emergency fallback for any errors
```

#### 3. **Search Architecture Rollback** ‚úÖ
- Removed complex v2.0 iterative deepening
- Restored proven v1.0 search pattern
- Simplified time management
- Added comprehensive error handling

#### 4. **Threading Stability** ‚úÖ
- Non-daemon threads for stable termination
- Timeout protection on all operations
- Graceful error recovery
- Robust stop command handling
