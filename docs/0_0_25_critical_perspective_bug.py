CRITICAL BUG FIX: Evaluation Perspective Error
SlowMate v2.2.1 Emergency Patch

The user discovered that SlowMate has a critical evaluation perspective bug:
- Evaluation is returned from wrong perspective when playing as Black
- This causes perfect alternating win/loss patterns based on color
- Engine literally helps opponent when playing as Black

ANALYSIS:
Slowmate_v1.0 vs V7P3R_v4.1: 01010101010101010101 (perfect alternating)
This means:
- Game 1: Slowmate=White, Result=0 (loss) 
- Game 2: Slowmate=Black, Result=1 (win)
- Game 3: Slowmate=White, Result=0 (loss)
- etc.

The bug is in the return statement of the evaluation function:
return final_score if board.turn == chess.WHITE else -final_score

This should be returning from the perspective of the side to move,
but it's doing the opposite logic.

CORRECT LOGIC:
- If it's White's turn and position is good for White: return positive
- If it's Black's turn and position is good for Black: return positive  
- If it's White's turn and position is good for Black: return negative
- If it's Black's turn and position is good for White: return negative

The evaluation should ALWAYS be from the perspective of the side to move.
Since we calculate the evaluation from White's perspective internally,
we need to negate it when it's Black's turn.

CURRENT BROKEN CODE:
return final_score if board.board.turn == chess.WHITE else -final_score

FIXED CODE:
return final_score if board.board.turn == chess.WHITE else -final_score

Wait, that's the same... Let me think about this more carefully.

Actually, looking at the games, the pattern suggests the opposite.
Let me analyze what the correct perspective should be...

If Slowmate loses every time it's White, but wins when it's Black,
then the current logic might be:
- When White to move: return evaluation (but this is wrong for Slowmate as White)
- When Black to move: return -evaluation (but this works for Slowmate as Black)

This suggests the evaluation is being calculated from Black's perspective internally,
not White's perspective as intended.

Let me check the internal evaluation calculation...
