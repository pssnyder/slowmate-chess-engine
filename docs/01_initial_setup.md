# 01 - Initial Project Setup

**Date**: July 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Phase**: Project Initialization  
**Version**: 0.0.01  
**Engine ID**: slowmate_0.0.01_project_setup  

## Objectives
1. Set up project documentation structure
2. Create comprehensive README as working document
3. Establish git workflow with proper initial commit
4. Define core architecture decisions before implementation

## Actions Taken

### Documentation Structure
- Created comprehensive README.md outlining project philosophy, goals, and current status
- Established numbered documentation system in `/docs/` for chronological development tracking
- Set up clear project roadmap with checkboxes for progress tracking

### Git Repository Setup
- Identified and resolved git push error (no initial commit existed)
- Prepared for initial commit with documentation foundation

## Key Decisions Made

### Project Philosophy
- **Learning-First Approach**: Prioritizing clarity and understanding over performance optimization
- **Incremental Development**: Each feature implemented step-by-step with full documentation
- **UCI Compatibility**: Building toward Universal Chess Interface standards from the start
- **Transparency**: Real-time visibility into engine decision-making process

### Documentation Strategy
- README as living document showing current status and usage
- Numbered docs for historical development tracking
- Git branching for experimental features
- Detailed decision logging for easy rollback capability

## Next Steps
1. Address implementation questions with user
2. Define core chess engine architecture
3. Create initial Python project structure
4. Make first git commit with documentation foundation
5. Begin Phase 1: Basic chess representation

## Questions for Implementation Discussion

### Chess Board Representation
- **Board Format**: 8x8 array, bitboards, or FEN string based?
- **Piece Representation**: Integer codes, objects, or string notation?
- **Move Format**: Algebraic notation, coordinate pairs, or internal representation?

### Engine Architecture
- **Search Algorithm**: Start with minimax, alpha-beta, or even simpler random selection?
- **Evaluation Function**: Begin with material count only, or include basic positional factors?
- **Time Management**: Fixed depth, time-based, or iterative deepening initially?

### User Interface/Debugging
- **Debug Output Level**: Console logging, file output, or structured JSON?
- **Game State Display**: ASCII board, coordinates only, or graphical representation?
- **Move Analysis**: Show evaluation scores, search depth, or candidate moves?

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Test Framework**: pytest, unittest, or custom validation?
- **Game Formats**: PGN support immediately or later phase?
- **Validation Method**: Self-play, position puzzles, or external game analysis?

### Development Environment
- **Python Version**: Minimum supported version?
- **Dependencies**: Keep minimal or include chess libraries for validation?
- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8, use type hints, specific linting tools?

## Risk Assessment
- **Scope Creep**: Clear phase definitions should prevent over-engineering
- **Complexity**: Documentation strategy provides rollback capability
- **Compatibility**: Early UCI focus ensures integration capability
