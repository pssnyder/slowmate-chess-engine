### Documentation Standards

#### Document Naming: `XX_feature_description.md`
- **00-09**: Core development milestones
- **10-19**: Advanced features (search, opening book, etc.)
- **20-29**: Optimization and performance
- **30-39**: Advanced algorithms and AI
- **40-49**: Tournament and competition features

#### Document Header Format:
```markdown
# XX - Feature Name

**Date**: July 19, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete / ‚è≥ In Progress / üìã Planned  
**Phase**: Development Phase Name  
**Version**: 0.0.XX  
**Engine ID**: slowmate_0.0.XX_feature_name  
```
