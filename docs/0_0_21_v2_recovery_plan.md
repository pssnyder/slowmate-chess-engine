**Date**: August 21, 2025  
**Status**: CRITICAL REGRESSION - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED  
**Priority**: P0 - Competitive Crisis  

## üö® CRISIS ASSESSMENT

### Catastrophic Performance Drop
- **SlowMate v2.0**: ELO 626 (tournament: 11/40 = 27.5%)
- **SlowMate v1.0**: ELO 1404 (tournament: 30.5/40 = 76.25%)
- **REGRESSION**: -778 ELO points (-55.4% performance drop)

### Competitive Context
Current competitive landscape:
