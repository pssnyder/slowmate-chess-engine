Generated: 2025-07-23 01:13:56

## Mission Statement
This document contains the complete "WHAT and WHY" inventory of all functionality
in SlowMate v0.3.03, organized by purpose and goal rather than implementation.
This enables systematic rebuilding from v0.1.0 baseline with architectural improvements.

## Current Problems Requiring Reversion

### Evaluation System
- **Problem**: Massive evaluation scores (+M500/8, -2500cp) in normal positions
- **Impact**: Makes engine look broken, affects UCI output, confuses GUIs
- **Root Cause**: Multiple evaluation paths, improper scaling, mate calculation bugs

### Uci Compliance
- **Problem**: Debug options not visible in Arena, inconsistent UCI output
- **Impact**: Can't debug in real tournament conditions, looks unprofessional
- **Root Cause**: UCI option registration issues, build process problems

### Performance Regression
- **Problem**: v0.3.x loses to v0.1.0 in tournaments
- **Impact**: Engine got worse instead of better
- **Root Cause**: Feature additions introduced bugs, evaluation interference

### Mate Detection
- **Problem**: False mate scores in early game positions
- **Impact**: Engine appears to miscalculate fundamental chess concepts
- **Root Cause**: Mate search depth issues, evaluation pipeline problems

### Build Consistency
- **Problem**: Fixes work in testing but not in built executables
- **Impact**: Can't deploy fixes to actual tournament use
- **Root Cause**: Build process doesn't reflect source code changes
