# SlowMate Chess Engine

A learning-focused, incremental chess engine built in Python with emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and UCI compatibility.

## Project Philosophy

SlowMate is designed as a step-by-step learning project where each feature is implemented incrementally with clear documentation of the development process. This approach allows for:

- **Transparency**: Every decision and implementation step is documented
- **Maintainability**: Simple, readable code over complex optimizations
- **Modularity**: Features can be easily added, modified, or rolled back
- **Compatibility**: Built to UCI (Universal Chess Interface) standards for integration with chess software

## Current Status

üèÜ **INTELLIGENT ENGINE - Strategic Decision Making!** üèÜ

The engine now features intelligent move selection with checkmate detection, stalemate avoidance, and strategic game state recognition!

### Completed Features
- ‚úÖ Project structure and documentation setup
- ‚úÖ Basic chess board representation (via python-chess)
- ‚úÖ Move generation (20 legal moves from starting position)
- ‚úÖ Legal move validation (automatic via python-chess)
- ‚úÖ Game state management (checkmate, stalemate, draw detection)
- ‚úÖ **UCI protocol implementation (Full compatibility!)**
- ‚úÖ **Nibbler.exe integration (Production validated!)**
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent move selection (Checkmate detection, stalemate avoidance!)**
- ‚è≥ Advanced search algorithms (Phase 3 - minimax/alpha-beta)
- ‚è≥ Position evaluation functions (Phase 3 - tactical/positional assessment)

## Core Goals

### Primary Goal (Phase 1)
**Legal Move Generation and Game Completion**: The engine must be able to play any legal chess move and see a complete game through to its conclusion (checkmate, stalemate, or draw).

### Secondary Goals (Future Phases)
- **Real-time Transparency**: Provide clear, real-time insights into the engine's decision-making process
- **UCI Compliance**: Full compatibility with Universal Chess Interface for integration with:
  - Arena Chess GUI
  - Nibbler.exe
  - Other UCI-compatible chess software
- **Competitive Integration**: Structured for potential deployment on chess platforms (pending platform policies)

## Architecture Overview

*To be filled as implementation progresses*

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pssnyder/slowmate_chess_engine.git
cd slowmate_chess_engine
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Connect to Nibbler.exe
1. Open Nibbler.exe
2. Add engine: Browse to `slowmate.bat` in the project folder
3. Engine will appear as "SlowMate 0.0.1-dev"
4. Start analyzing positions or play games!

### Manual UCI Testing
```bash
# Test UCI protocol
echo "uci" | slowmate.bat

# Run comprehensive test
python test_uci.py
```

### Basic Demo
Run a complete random game:
```bash
python demo.py
```

### Engine API
```python
from slowmate.intelligence import IntelligentSlowMateEngine

# Create intelligent engine
engine = IntelligentSlowMateEngine()

# Play intelligent moves with reasoning
while not engine.is_game_over():
    move = engine.play_intelligent_move()
    reasoning = engine.get_move_reasoning()
    print(f"Engine played: {move}")
    print(f"Strategy: {reasoning}")

print(f"Game over: {engine.get_game_result()}")
```

### Intelligence Testing
```bash
# Test intelligent move selection
python test_intelligence.py

# Toggle intelligence on/off via UCI
echo "setoption name Intelligence value false" | slowmate.bat
```

### Current Features
- **Intelligent Move Selection**: Checkmate detection, stalemate/draw avoidance
- **UCI Protocol**: Full compatibility with chess GUIs (Nibbler, Arena, etc.)
- **Nibbler.exe Integration**: Production-validated, runs complete games
- **Strategic Decision Making**: Prioritizes winning moves, avoids losing positions  
- **Complete Game Support**: Plays from start to checkmate/stalemate/draw
- **Real-time Analysis**: Detailed reasoning for every move selection
- **Robust Game Logic**: Handles all chess rules via python-chess library
- **Engine Testing Ready**: Can compete intelligently against other engines
- **Professional Standards**: Industry-grade UCI compliance with analysis output

## Development Roadmap

See `/docs/` folder for detailed development timeline and decision history.

## Testing

‚úÖ **Production Validated**:
- **Nibbler.exe**: Full integration tested with complete games
- **UCI Compliance**: All protocol commands validated
- **Self-Play Testing**: Multiple game variations completed successfully
- **Real-World Performance**: Stable operation in professional chess software

**Additional Testing Capabilities**:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration with Arena Chess GUI  
- Engine vs engine competition testing
- Tournament-style automated play
