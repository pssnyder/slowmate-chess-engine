# SlowMate Chess Engine

A learning-focused, incremental chess engine built in Python with emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and UCI compatibility.

## Project Philosophy

SlowMate is designed as a step-by-step learning project where each feature is implemented incrementally with clear documentation of the development process. This approach allows for:

- **Transparency**: Every decision and implementation step is documented
- **Maintainability**: Simple, readable code over complex optimizations
- **Modularity**: Features can be easily added, modified, or rolled back
- **Compatibility**: Built to UCI (Universal Chess Interface) standards for integration with chess software

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Project Initialization Phase** ðŸš§

The engine is currently in the initial setup phase. No chess functionality has been implemented yet.

### Completed Features
- [ ] Project structure and documentation setup
- [ ] Basic chess board representation
- [ ] Move generation
- [ ] Legal move validation
- [ ] Game state management
- [ ] Basic move evaluation
- [ ] UCI protocol implementation
- [ ] Basic search algorithm

## Core Goals

### Primary Goal (Phase 1)
**Legal Move Generation and Game Completion**: The engine must be able to play any legal chess move and see a complete game through to its conclusion (checkmate, stalemate, or draw).

### Secondary Goals (Future Phases)
- **Real-time Transparency**: Provide clear, real-time insights into the engine's decision-making process
- **UCI Compliance**: Full compatibility with Universal Chess Interface for integration with:
  - Arena Chess GUI
  - Nibbler.exe
  - Other UCI-compatible chess software
- **Competitive Integration**: Structured for potential deployment on chess platforms (pending platform policies)

## Architecture Overview

*To be filled as implementation progresses*

## Installation

*To be documented once first working version is complete*

## Usage

*To be documented with examples once basic functionality is implemented*

## Development Roadmap

See `/docs/` folder for detailed development timeline and decision history.

## Testing

The engine will be tested with:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration with Arena Chess GUI
- Integration with Nibbler.exe for analysis
- Self-play testing for game completion validation

## Contributing

This is primarily a learning project, but suggestions and educational discussions are welcome.

## License

*To be determined*
