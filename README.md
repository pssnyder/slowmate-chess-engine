# SlowMate Chess Engine

A self-learning, incremental chess engine built in Python with emphasis on clarity, simplicity, and UCI compatibility.

## Project Philosophy

SlowMate is designed as a step-by-step learning project where each feature is implemented incrementally with clear documentation of the development process. This approach allows for:

- **Transparency**: Every decision and implementation step is documented
- **Self-Learning**: Engine analyzes its own games to build tactical knowledge
- **Maintainability**: Simple, readable code over complex optimizations
- **Modularity**: Features can be easily added, modified, or rolled back
- **Compatibility**: Built to UCI (Universal Chess Interface) standards for integration with chess software

## Current Status

â”œâ”€â”€ engine.py              # Main UCI engine interface
â”œâ”€â”€ intelligence.py        # Tactical evaluation and move selection
â”œâ”€â”€ knowledge/             # Knowledge base system (NEW)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ opening_book.py    # Position-based opening lookup
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ opening_weights.py # Preference weighting system
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ endgame_patterns.py# Strategic endgame preparation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ endgame_tactics.py # Checkmate pattern recognition

```

### Integration Flow
```
Move Selection Priority:
1. Endgame Tactics (immediate checkmates)
2. Opening Book (position-based with preferences)
3. Strategic Endgame Patterns (positional preparation)
4. Tactical Evaluation (SEE-based analysis)
5. Minimax Search (alpha-beta with quiescence)
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pssnyder/slowmate_chess_engine.git
cd slowmate_chess_engine
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell:
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Linux/Mac:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install python-chess

## Usage

### UCI Engine (Recommended)
```bash
python main.py
```
Then use UCI commands or integrate with chess GUI software like Nibbler, Arena, or Fritz.

### Direct Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive knowledge base tests
python testing/test_knowledge_base.py

# Run opening book specific tests  
python testing/test_opening_book.py
```

## Testing
